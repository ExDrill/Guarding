## What is it?

Guarding is a Fabric 1.18.2 mod that adds in new mechanics to shields to make them more unique and immersive (as well as balance changes)!

### Parrying

Parrying is a new mechanic added that allows for more skill based fights. If you manage to block a perfectly timed hit, you will knockback the enemy slightly!

### How can it be activated?

Parrying can be activated by sneaking and timing a shield block just before you get hit! Keep in mind parrying will also disable your shield for a second to avoid parry spam.

### New Shield Enchantments!

- Barbed: If you perform a parry, your attacker will get damaged, this also works like thorns where the shield will take more damage than usual.

- Pummeling: If you perform a parry, you will send more knockback to your opponent!

### Shield Hugging Punishment

If you get attacked while your shield has been out for more than 10 seconds, it will disable for 5 seconds!
